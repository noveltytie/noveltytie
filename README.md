hey, i'm noveltytie. i'm a cs undergrad hoping to go into tech law. most of my experience is in html + css, but i'm currently learning python. probably going to be some pretty basic stuff for now (mainly storage for class or small interesting projects) but i hope to work on some bigger stuff soon as i begin to spread my wings!
